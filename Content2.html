    <h2>Secondary Climate Change Effects On New Zealand </h2>

        <br> One of the other impacts on New Zealand that are not immediately seen to us is the other effects on our economy and common households in our country. These impacts of Climate action are serious and are commonly overlooked. 
        
        <p>One of the effects of climate change on our country is the increased serious weather events and disasters that will now be a more common occurrence in New Zealand. This will lead to higher insurance in more households due to disasters being a more common thing such as floods therefore insurance companies will raise the price as it will be more common to claim insurance. This will lead to fewer households especially with large families not being able to afford the insurance from the higher prices. </p>
        
        <p> The other thing that will be affected by the increased temperatures due to Climate Change is hotter weather in the summer. This will lead to damage to transport infrastructure. This is caused by the increased heat and therefore is a massive negative effect on New Zealand. Such infrastructure is roads which cause massive disruptions all around the country and increased repair costs in New Zealand. </p>
