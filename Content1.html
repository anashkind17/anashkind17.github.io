    <h2>Effects of higher temperature in NZ</h2>
    
        <br> With the recent changes to our environment it is at great risk that we will see increased temperatures not only to our world but to our country. Increased temperatures in the New Zealand environment cause serious issues and these are listed below
        
        <p> One of the worst effects from increased temperatures is the rising sea level in New Zealand. The cause of rising sea levels from higher temperatures is the ice caps melting. The large masses of the ice caps melting from the increased temperatures will lead to masses of water that previousl was not there to be released in the ocean. This is a major risk especially in New Zealand as we are among the closest countries to the South Pole and these effects will be the worst. </p>
        
        <p> The other effect that you need to be informed about is from the increased temperatures is droughts. As it gets warmer and rain patterns change there is a much higher risk of droughts. This is a massive negative for New Zealand as we rely on farming as one of our main sources of income and for many people that is going to become inconsistent with increased droughts. </p>
