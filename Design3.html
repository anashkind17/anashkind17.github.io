        <h1>A Brief Aakrista History</h1>
         
         <ul>
         
         <li>The Brief History of Aakrista starts in Nepal, when he moved out of Nepal he moved here to Christchurch in New Zealand. Here is also some stuff about his name: know how to listen to others.
A	The letter A is for ambition and adaptability, the strength to adjust to whatever comes on the way.
K	This 'K' implies that one is not a big fan of uncertainty and is more likely to give a higher value to rational thoughts than to feelings.
R	The energy of the 'R' resonates with the number 9, which channels a sense of duty, as well as tolerance for others' behaviors.
I	Within the 'I' there is a need to take massive action when needed to meet goals and this is sort of raised to the rank of golden rule.
S	Negatively, the S's power induces pessimistic thoughts and a cynical attitude.
T	When it comes to social life, 'T' displays a very inclusive attitude, that has other people feel comfortable in their company.
A	The cross bar contained in the shape of the 'A' is reminiscent of a rung on a ladder, where one needs to step before ascending to the top.</li>
